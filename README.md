After celebrating my 18th birthday and eager to earn 
some extra income, I stumbled upon the world of 
matched betting. This strategy leverages bookmaker 
promotions, such as free bets and bet boosts, aimed at 
attracting new customers (primarily on football/horse 
racing betting) and uses betting exchanges to secure 
risk free profit regardless of the outcome of bets. As I 
continued to explore this industry, I noticed recurring 
patterns and trends within horse racing exchange 
markets. This, combined with my interest in financial 
exchanges and an aspiration to delve into the general 
world of data analysis/science, fuelled my desire to 
conduct further research and investigation. The 
unforeseen COVID-19 pandemic that greatly impacted 
global sports, hindered my progress5
. Despite this 
setback, I persevered and eventually produced initial 
algorithms by mid to late 2020. The report below 
recounts the pivotal aspects of this journey, 
culminating in four of the most fundamental and 
critical early studies, which would ultimately lead to the 
development of the algorithms and systems that I 
employ today.
